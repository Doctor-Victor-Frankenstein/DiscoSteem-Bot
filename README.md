# DiscoSteem-Bot (0.2.1)

**A Discord bot that interacts with the Steem blockchain API**

## Release 0.2.1

### New implementations

DiscoSteem-Bot now offers an upvote system from your Discord server. To vote for an article you can simply add a reaction,that you have previously defined, to a Steemit/Busy link.

The curate function has been improved to allow data to be stored in a JSON file. This allows simple data reuse and also allows more efficient processing.

> The $curate function now offers two services depending on the channels you have configured.

#### For all users: 

Configure in config.json the parameter **postSubmissionChan** all links and descriptions posted on this channel will go directly to the channel you configured with **savingSubmissionChan**.

#### For moderators and curators

Configure in config.json the parameter **curationChan** all links and descriptions posted on this channel will go directly to the channel you have configured with **savingChan**.

In addition to being saved in a different channel, the data will be saved in the file **post-saved.json** which will allow you to process them much more quickly and simply.

**WARNING** : For more consistency think of configuring the permissions of your **curationChan** so that nobody can write there, but simply add reactions. This will allow you to have a very clean channel and therefore a better visibility to view the selected articles.

We have implemented the $rank function to display a Steem user's rank. The function calculates the VEST and returns the rank and number of VEST remaining to reach the next level.

### Bug fixing

Stream's function was struggling to last over time. We have corrected the major problems and now you can Streamer the Steem blockchain without interruption.

We also added a function allowing the bot to detect its disconnection, which allows us to restart it immediately.

We've added a feature that allows you to delete messages quickly and easily. With the $clear function add the number of messages (max 100) to delete and the bot will clean your Discord channel in a split second.

## Function of the bot

**To make it simple, here is the result of the **$help** command from DiscoSteem-Bot, you will find all the features supported for the moment.**

- **$last-post** followed by the author of your choice, displays the link to the author's latest article.
- **$created** takes two parameters separated by spaces. the first one is the tag you want to display 
and the second one is the number (min = 1, max = 15) of items to display. 
***This option is reserved for the administrator and anyone who has permission to edit a channel.***
- **search** does an article search based on the parameters you specify. ***- Ex: $search planetenamek fr 30 -*** will search in my last 30 articles and return all articles containing the tag **FR**
- **$bal** displays the wallet of the Steem account of your choice. ***- Ex: $bal planetenamek -*** will display my wallet.
***Each command ($...) that requires a parameter must be separated by a space***
- **$curate_Description of your post here_Full Steemit link to your post** saves those information on "curateChan" or on "savingSubmissionChan"
- **$clear** deletes messages from the channel you are on. **- Ex : $clear 30 -**
- **$rank** Displays the rank of the user of your choice. (minnow, dolphin, orca)  

### StreamOperation

You can now display the Steemit articles of your choice directly on your Discord server. Change the settings to suit your needs in the **config.json**.

You can specify **a single principalTag** and as **many altTags as you like**. The bot will sort the articles and send them to the channels you specify in the **config.json** file.
